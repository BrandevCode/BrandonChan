## Project Goal
The main reason I wanted to make this animation was to show others that I can animate. I have many animation projects, but never one that I completed so I was very determined to finish this one. Another reason is to give people a peak into what my work life is like. Usually looks like this (maybe minus it being night time). The last reason is that I did not have anything to put for the "Programming" thumbnail on this websites homepage. You can check it out there now!

## Reference Video
It has been a while since I have drawn anything. So to speed up the process, I filmed myself in order to get the angle and key poses for my movements.

## Sketch
This is where I sketched the poses for the animation based on the video above. You'll notice that I only drew the "key" poses which are the parts where the animation begins/ends so I can later add more in-between frames if needed.

## Linework
Once the sketches were done, I added in the actual lineart. One fault that I noticed during this part, was that I did not have an actual character design in mind. So you'll notice that his appearance changes throughout the animation. Lesson learned, make sure to have a design to reference before doing the line art.

## Colouring
This was the most time consuming part. Every new frame had to be colored and shaded. Next time, I will refer to this colouring tutorial by Nicca Ch:

## Compositing
I am surprised how easy it was to composite the animation. Though I believe this was because of my previous experience using video editors. I was going to reference this video <a href="https://youtu.be/R0Xfbzgyj30">How to Make Your Fake Anime Real</a> but ended up just playing around with the many default effects in Adobe After Effects. 

Here are the steps I took and some examples of the effects I used:

1. Exported the clip studio project into two videos. One for the animation of the character with a green screen background and another for the background. This is so I can apply different effects to both layers.
2. Imported the videos into After Effects and removed the green color by using the "Color Range" effect. 
3. Added a mask to the computer screen so I can change the effects on it separately.  
4. Added the "Curves" effect to change the lighting.  
5. To make the flickering effect on the computer I just slightly changed the brightness up and down every couple of frames or so. I then added some of the effect onto the character.

After Effects CS6 for compositing. <a href="https://olm.co.jp/rd/technology/tools/?lang=en" target="_blank" >OLM</a> for smoothing lines.

### Hardware
