I strongly advocate using <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newCT_93.htm" target="_blank">metaphorical thinking</a>. This is the act of comparing different problems and finding their similar concepts to link them to a real solution. At first glance, boxing is just a violent sport about knocking the opponent out, has actually taught me many important ideologies that aided me in also knocking out problems in other aspects of my life.

## How To Be Self Disciplined

I never went to the boxing gym because someone was forcing me. I went there and I was well aware that I was going to be exhausted and in pain. There were days when I wanted to give up. I did on occasion. That did not mean that I gave up though. I would make up for it by working twice as hard the next day because I knew that the satisfaction was not immediate. I had to look past the current struggle towards my end goal. A lot of boxing is about repetition like doing 100 jabs in a row or skipping rope 1000 times. It can be difficult and seem pointless at times, but at the end of it all, it was worth it. I now have a clearer voice in my head telling me to "keep going no matter what".

## Have Confidence In Yourself

Initially, I walked into the boxing ring for sparring sessions with excitement and fear. I felt like I was in an entirely different and claustrophobic world. I was also not alone, I was being hunted. I would pull up my arms to guard more often then I should have. Every time I swung my arms out to retaliate, I would get hit back. The issue was, I had fear in me. Fear is normal, but understand that once you lower that fear, your confidence will grow. Confidence grows. It sounds easy, but when I was told by my trainers to relax more because my guard was too tense it scared me. They wanted me to get out of my shell and move. Slowly I was becoming less tense and surprisingly got hit less. I was able to improve because I was more confident in my abilities and understood the rules of the world. Now overcoming my fears is what gives me the most excitement.

Here is a video on Muhammad Ali and how he shows over-the-top confidence:

I know this isn't a boxing video, but I think this is a perfect display of why we need confidence.

## Create Habits That Will Improve Your Life

A lot of boxing is about the reaction. Having your body automatically respond to a situation so your mind can focus on strategizing. Good habits are something I want to have more in my life. There are simple concepts to grasp when creating good habits. Practice and repetition. After practicing my footwork and 1-2 punches many many times, I am creating the muscle memory to do them with ease and without thinking. Often after a while of repetitive practice, it felt like doing the same motion was not helping. At these points, it is important to change it up. I started to vary the timing on my 1-2 punches, do a different combination of them and add feints in-between. The next time I attempt to create a good habit and find that I am unable to be motivated to practice or keep with the repetition, I'll remember my time during boxing and how rewarding it felt to succeed.

## Have A Competitive Attitude

In my boxing gym, it was easy to see others and see how they practiced. I would imagine what I would do against them when I shadowboxed and try to find a way to exploit their weak spots while trying not to expose mine. The competition allowed me to visualize my strengths and weaknesses more clearly. It also kept me motivated to fix those weaknesses and reflect on why I had them. My strive to win against them also lead to more creative thinking and willingness to try new things to get an advantage over them. My mind was full of thoughts about strategy. What if I practice my footwork to be faster than them or what if I do more feints to get in range because my reach is short? Competition kept me motivated and helped my improve my skills.

## Have A Strong Appearance And Inspire Others

Just like how having a good posture during an interview is important, you need to show your confidence. Appearance is your opponents first impression of you and that may be the make it or break it difference in the fight. When you walk onto stage your appearance will be the first thing that the audience sees. How do you want to be shown? I want to be seen as someone who truly and honestly believes in himself. I want to inspire others.
