I miss school. It was a place where I made many of my closest friends and was a time where I had so much time to spend on video games. I could not wait for my graduation so I would not have to deal with homework anymore. I could not wait to forget everything I learned in school, but why is that? 

Recently, I have been educating myself on a bunch of topics that I find essential for becoming the best person I can be. A lot of them I can relate back to my education in school.

1. Exercizing in P.E Class. Learning to exercise in order to stay in shape and improve your physical/mental abilities.
2. Notetaking. I was always told to take notes but I would hate doing them. This was mainly due to a couple of factors. I did not have good writing so after I was finished with my notes I would hate looking at them. If I wanted to make my writing look good I would be extremely slow and lose track of what the teacher was talking about.
3. Planning for due dates. We were all given planners at the beginning of the school year and I would never use it.
4. Homework. Doing the example questions are how we memorize and take in the information.
5. Presentations. Showing that you can articulate what is written into something understandable to an audience
6. Ask Questions. "there is no such thing as a bad question". To ask questions is to be human. It is how we learn.
7. Group Projects. We will need to work as a team in the future.
8. Math. Indirectly teaching us about logic in the world. 

Many of these could be found as intuitive but for me and probably many of my classmates. School is thought as something trival and a boulder to get over in order to get freedom and independence.
