**4 Rules for Life**
</div>
<div class="box-content" markdown="1">
1. **No more zero days** [something, anything, is better than nothing]
2. **Be grateful to the three "you"s** [past, present and future you]
3. **Forgive yourself** [appreciate past efforts, even without actions]
4. **Exercise and books** [a double-dose of intelligence and reinforcement]
</div>
</div>

I found this while going through **/r/getdisciplined** and it was a very inspirational read. In the post there is a person who is asking for help on what to do in their life when they are feeling useless. The commenter by the username ryans01 tells him not to give up an follow those 4 rules. These rules are very simple to understand but can be hard to execute.

**Summary**
</div>
<div class="box-content" markdown="1">
Self improvement will not solve all of your problems. The smartest people in the world are not the ones who use self improvement videos and books to keep themselves motivated. They are **obsessed** over what they do. It is also not enough to do the research on what you love. You need to take the first step and get the experience.

**Summary**
</div>
<div class="box-content" markdown="1">
1. Why should you bother improving yourself? So you and those around you don't have to suffer.
2. How do you fix it? Find the problems throughout your life and fix it. One by one. 
3. What should you fix? Fix the bad habits you do everyday. We tend to ignore the small habits when they are actually the most important to fix.
4. What if I can't fix it? Ignore it for now and move on to something you can do.
