## Who are you?
I'm Brandon. I know, isn't it shocking that my name is the exact same as this site! Jokes aside, in the past I believe others would perceive me as the short quiet Asian kid, but I feel like that doesn't fit me anymore. I'm trying my best to change that label to instead be the hardworking, intelligent, and strong Asian kid. 

## How have you been?
I've been surviving this difficult year quite well, other than not being able to socialize as much. I changed my mindset to think of this tough year as an opportunity instead of a hindrance. I've been working on a bunch of personal projects like this website, I had a good spree doing morning jogs everyday and made a couple of <a href="https://brandonchan.ca/Night-Coding">animations</a>.

## What have you been up to recently?
Mainly my time has been spent working at my job as a Business Intelligence Developer at <a href="https://powerex.com/" target="_blank">Powerex</a>. Outside of my job I have been working on this website, binge watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_Heist" target="_blank">Money Heist</a>, and learning to create some pixel art for a video game I am hoping to develop.

## What posts will there be on this website?

I made this website so I can post anything I find interesting or useful to others. You will find updates on my latest projects as well as any random nuggets of information that I think deserve more exposure. 

Here are some upcoming posts titles I have planned:

1. **5 Personal Finance Lessons School Didn't Teach You**
2. **Why You Should Use A Note Taking App**
3. **How To Win An Argument**
4. **Common Myths You Should Stop Believing In**
5. **My Experience With PRK Laser Eye Surgery**


## Do you have anything posted right now?

Yup! You can find them at <a href="http://brandonchan.ca/" target="_blank">brandonchan.ca</a> under **Latest Posts**, clicking on the <a href="https://brandonchan.ca/blog" target="_blank">brandonchan.ca/blog</a> tab or by searching in the sidebar.

Here are some posts that I think most people will find useful/interesting:
