Is there a reason to create new year resolutions? It's just a way for us to make unrealistic goals only to forget about them and not follow through. So why do so many people create them?

## The Problem With New Year Resolutions

1. They're just a _want, a wish, a vague idea_.
2. Created during an _arbitrary moment in time_ where we decide that we need to make a big change. In actuality, we can make these goals at any time of the year.
3. When we don't achieve our goals, we will _wait a whole year to reflect on them_ again. We don't reflect on these resolutions enough. 
4. A reset button for the things we've done wrong in the past. A new year does not magically make us a new and better person. We cannot truly be a better person until _we redeem ourselves of our mistakes_.
5. Motivation comes and goes. We are _creatures of habit_, meaning if we don't create a routine we will fall back into our bad habits.


## Do We Need New Year Resolutions?

We don't necessarily need a new year resolution. However, making resolutions and reflecting on oneself is important. Resolutions give us _something to look forward to_ and _keep working towards_. Even if we make mistakes and don't reach our resolution, making it _shows our resolve to change_ and _become a better person_.

## How To Keep Your New Years Resolution

1. **Set the vision**: Imagine what you want the end result to look like.
2. **Cluster and prioritize**: Group your resolutions and set priorities. Do first things first.
3. **Draft your OKRs (Objective and Key Results)**: Draft your objectives and outcomes. Use the **SMART** method to create your objective. This is to determine **what** you want to achieve and **how** you will achieve them.
4. **Define your action plan**: Take a look back at the draft and determine if the key results are measureable. Be specific.

**When creating an OKR ask yourself these questions:**
1. What do you want to achieve?
2. How are you going to measure success?
3. What are you going to do to make progress?

<br>

**Example of an OKR**:

**Objective**:
Lose 10lbs By June 1st

**Key Result 1**:
Go to gym twice a week

**Key Result 2**:
Run 10k every week

**Key Result 3**:
No fast food for a month

**Key Result 4**:
Learn to cook a healthy meal on the weekends

<br>

**Things to keep in mind:**

1. Don't be hard on yourself.
2. Don't think of success from motivation, will power and self control. Think instead by small goals and small wins.
3. Pick ambitious goals that will challenge (but still within reach).
4. Be Proactive. Focus on what you can control.
5. Start with the task you are able to do first.
6. Create a habit.

## Conclusion

I think the most exciting part of new years resolutions is that we are going through this change together. Some people may look down upon the many posts about starting a new years resolution, but I think it is something wonderful and should be looked on in a more positive light. New year resolutions are a great reminder that we all are striving to become better than we were before.
