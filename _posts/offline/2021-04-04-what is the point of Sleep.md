You probably already know that we all need sleep and that it's important for us to get enough of it, but **what is enough?** Also, **why is it sometimes so hard to fall asleep?** **What are some ways we can improve our sleep hygiene?** We spend about 1/3 of our life sleeping. That is so much time we waste by sleeping. Is it really a waste? In this post, you will find the answers to these questions. Sleeping is probably the most important habit we all have and should be a task we **prioritize** more often then we usually do.

## Our Human Nature

We are biological creatures. Just like any animal we need sleep. Researchers haven't been able to find a single animal that doesn't have some kind of sleeping state. It is within all of us to get the rest we need to survive.

### Why We Sleep

**Growth**
- For children and young adults, the body releases growth hormones during deep sleep. The body also increases the production of proteins, which we need for **cell growth** and to **speed the repair of our injuries**

**Nervous system function**

- Sleep helps with our **memory**. It aids in making connections to events to help us recall different moments in our brain.
- Being **sleep-deprived** will cause us to have our **performance and ability to think impacted**. We may even experience **mood swings** and **hallucinations**.

**Survival**
- Sleep protects us against **infections**, **malignancy**, and many **illnesses**.

**Well-being**
- Those who don’t get enough sleep are at higher risk for developing various health conditions including **obesity**, **diabetes** and **heart problems**.

## Why Falling Asleep Is Difficult

 **Very hot or cold temperatures**
- Can disrupt REM sleep. We’re less able to regulate body temperature during REM sleep.

 **Stress**
- When we get into the cycle of worry our mind may keep wondering which keeps us awake.

**Alcohol**
- May help us fall into a light sleep. But it reduces the deeper stages of sleep and REM sleep and leads to more disrupted sleep.

**Caffeine and pseudoephedrine**
- They may cause insomnia, an inability to sleep. Watch out for caffeinated drinks such as coffee and drugs such as diet pills and decongestants.

**Medications**
- Some types of drugs such as antidepressants can cause less REM sleep.

**Smoking**
- Often causes them to sleep lightly and have less REM sleep. They may wake up after a few hours because they experience nicotine withdrawal.

### Sleep Debt

- If we haven’t slept well or long enough for a few days, we might create a sleep debt.
- **We can’t necessarily make up our debt by sleeping a lot on the weekends.** It’s best to get enough sleep all week long.

## Feeling Sleepy Throughout The Day

**Diet/Nutrition**
- Remember that even though we may be on a diet and want to cut down on the calories, they are very important for us to get energy. We could be short on vitamin D, vitamin B12, iron, magnesium, or potassium. Try eating some quick and healthy foods like bananas, oatmeal, green tea and nuts.

**Lack Of or Too Much Sleep**
- Make sure we get the right amount of sleep consistently.

**Being Overweight**
- Because of the extra weight, it will cause your body to expend more energy to do everyday tasks.

**Sedentary Lifestyle**
- As we've changed our lifestyles to include more office like work we need to ensure that we keep moving. Try taking a walk, it will keep your body active as well give you fresh air to relieve your stress.

**Medication**
- Some medication can cause us to be more alert. Make sure to keep an eye on the side effects of the medication you are taking. 

**Stress**
- We may be overwhelmed with everything going on with our lives. Try finding ways to reduce your stress by [exercising](https://brandonchan.ca/What-Is-The-Point-Of-Exercise), [meditating](https://brandonchan.ca/what-is-the-point-of-Meditation) or [eating healthy](https://brandonchan.ca/What-Is-The-Point-Of-Home-Cooking).


## Effective Sleep Hygiene

### How Much Is Enough

It depends on our age but. If we feel tired throughout the day try adjusting how much sleep we get. People also seem to not realize that too much sleep can also be a factor in why we feel tired as well. 

- **Newborns**: 14-17 hours
- **Infant**: 12-15 hours
- **Toddler**: 11-14 hours
- **Preschool**: 10-13 hours
- **School-age**: 9-11 hours
- **Teen**: 8-10 hours
- **Adults**: 7-9 hours

### How To Fix Your Sleep

- **(1) Make sleep a routine:** Having a sleeping routine maintains the timing of your body's **circadian rhythm** (internal clock) and can help you fall asleep and wake up more easily. This includes keeping the routine on weekends and vacations.
- **(2) Clear your mind:** Our beds tend to be a magnet for our worries as we reflect on the next day. A way to approach this is by creating a to-do list or [meditating](https://brandonchan.ca/what-is-the-point-of-Meditation) before you go to bed so you can be better prepared.
- **(3) Create a comfy environment:** Beds and pillows are supposed to make you comfortable when you sleep; you need to make sure they are doing the right job. Also, avoid bright lights and loud sounds. Make sure the room is at a comfortable temperature. Around **18.3°C (65°F)**
- **(4) Get exercise:** [Exercise](https://brandonchan.ca/What-Is-The-Point-Of-Exercise) has been found to decrease sleep complaints and insomnia in people. Though try to avoid exercise a couple of hours before sleeping.
- **(5) Relax:** Make a winding down routine by doing a relaxing activity to release all that built-up cortisol. Try taking a warm bath, [reading](https://brandonchan.ca/what-is-the-point-of-Reading-Books),  [meditating](https://brandonchan.ca/what-is-the-point-of-Meditation), or listening to relaxing music/sounds.
- **(6) Avoid artificial light:** This means not using your phone or computer directly before bed. Try using blue light filters on your devices or wearing eye masks.
- **(7) Don't Lie In Bed Awake**
If your mind is active while laying in bed, try to get out of bed and find a soothing activity to do. Reading a book or writing in a journal are some light activities that may help. 
- **(8) See your family doctor:**  If you've tried everything and nothing is helping please contact your doctor. You may have a sleeping disorder and need to get it under control using a different solution.

### How To Wake Up With Energy

- **Get Sunlight:** Research has shown that natural light in the morning will help you sleep better. **Sunshine regulates our circadian rhythm** by telling our body when to increase and decrease our melatonin levels.
- **Drink-Water**: This not only forces us to get out of bed, but it also helps you rehydrate after a long period without water.
- **Splash Water On Your Face:** Provides a stimulating shock to your body to get your heart rate moving.
- **Meditate:** Though this seems counter-intuitive when trying to wake up, it has been known to help us be **focused, content, and optimistic. It works well in setting our mood for the day.**
