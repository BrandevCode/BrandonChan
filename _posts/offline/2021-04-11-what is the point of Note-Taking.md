I feel like everyone can see the benefits of taking notes. It helps us to prioritize our tasks, keep an archive that can be referenced in the future and deepens our understanding of the topics we may be studying. I feel like I missed out by not being organized with my notes sooner. What made it so difficult for me to start note-taking? 

## Being Consistent Is Hard

We all have different lives with different schedules and most of the time when someone else recommends a note-taking routine it doesn't fit into our life. Also, we know that note-taking isn't easy, it's another commitment that we have to have in our lives. So what makes it such a commitment?

**Priority**

When we don't make note-taking a **priority**, we end up being lazy and procrastinate. It's difficult to come back to our notes when we completely forget where we were last at. It's the beginning of note-taking that is the hardest because we don't have the structure built yet.

**Lack of Design Knowledge**

If we do some research on different styles of notebooks, we'll find a lot of feminine-styled notes that granted, are very visually pleasing, but tends to create a boundary for the majority of non-creative folks to start their own. I blame my bad penmanship to be the problem with my notes as it was slow and not pleasant to look at.

**Too Much To Write**

There can be times when it's much easier for us to retain the knowledge in our memory rather than writing it down. To some, it may save time for them to just memorize everything rather than writing it down.

**Nothing To Write**

If we are living a very simple life then we may not feel the need to write anything. 

**Worse For Your Memory**

By writing notes down we may not be paying attention to the actual content we are writing. There have been actual [studies](https://www.panopto.com/blog/put-down-that-notebook-new-studies-find-taking-notes-is-bad-for-your-memory/#:~:text=Bloomberg%20Business%20summarizes%20the%20findings,Taking%20Notes%20Kills%20Your%20Memory.&text=It%20turns%20out%2C%20taking%20notes,we%20can%20write%20it%20down.) that have shown this to be true. 

## Why You Should Take Notes

**Organization**. Without keeping any notes I would never have been able to make this blog. It has allowed me to:

1. Keep track of my daily, monthly and yearly **goals**
2. Free up my **memory** so I can focus on more immediate tasks
3. **Reflect** on myself and what I want to achieve

**Entropy**, which is a concept in thermal dynamics that states that everything is attempting to go towards disorder, randomness or uncertainty. This is a great metaphor for how when we stop keeping our good habits and being organized, we lose ourselves in the realm of disarray.

### Benefits Of Note-Taking

- Better **prioritization** skills
- Keep **focused**
- Deepens our **understanding** of the topic
- Promotes more **self-reflections**
- Shows our **progress**

## Note-Taking Structure

**Convenient**

- Have your notebook **visible** to you or easily **accessible**
- Allow it to be **searchable**

**Visually Appealing**

- By making use of underlines, colours and bullet points you can make it easier to recognize the key points
- Creates a more welcoming environment for you to come back to

**Have a system**

Have answers to these questions:

- Where are you putting your notes? Physical notebook or online tool?
- **How often** will you write in your notes?
- What is the **trigger** to let you know that you need to write notes?
- What information do you need to include?
    - For example, a To-Do list needs to include the **name** of the task, the **priority** of how important it is, and the **status** of whether it is done or not.

## Notebooks You Need

## Online Notes

You may be looking at my templates above and wondering what tool is that? I use [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) for all of my notes. I find it very useful because:

- I'm more use to typing on a keyboard than writing with a pencil.
- It's easier to format and rearrange the content.
- I can access my notes on my desktop, laptop and phone.
- It's fast to access and I will never lose my notes.
- I can include multimedia content like links, images and screenshots.

If you want to try some out for yourself there are plenty of applications out there such as Todoist, Trello, Microsoft To-Do and Evernote

## Conclusion

As with most routines, note-taking can be difficult to start. Even so, we should remember the importance that it brings. By being organized we can be **better prepared for our goals, more reliable to others, and able to reference important information efficiently**. As with any habit, to be consistent you need to make it **visible** and **satisfying**. I am very glad to have found a great note-taking style that works for me, and I hope you are able to as well.
