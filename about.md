So you've found my website!

If we have never met before, I would like to say nice to meet you and ask who you are, but sadly this page is about me and not about you.

Hi, my name is **Brandon**, and I do not know how to describe myself. This is due to my personality constantly evolving throughout my life. As an example, when I was younger, I was very timid and shy. I was like this because I was afraid of saying something I did not mean and kept my words and feelings to myself. As I grew older, I realized its okay to admit to my mistakes and care a little less about what others think. This gave me more confidence to be more social and true to who I am. Finding who I am is one of the reasons why I created this website and I hope I can continue to evolve and become a better person.

Another reason is to help others by giving them support on topics I am either familiar with or passionate about such as **coding, drawing** and **healthy habits**. I am in no means an expert, but I hope I will be able to spark interest and maybe add to someones life.

Lastly I made this so **employers** can find out more about who I am and what I know. For more info please navigate here: "ADD A LINK HERE BRANDON"
