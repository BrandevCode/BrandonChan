        <h1 class="header font-title">Hello World!</h1>
        <p>
        For the last 7 years since I've been in computer science, I have been inspired by so many intelligent people who create amazing projects and share them to the world. The main purpose of this website is to give back and share my projects to the world in the hopes that I can inspire someone out there. Keep in mind, I am no expert and I only wish to give you the tools and motivation that will hopefully benefit your life in some way.

        <h1 class="header font-title">Who am I?</h1>
        <p>
        Hey there! My name is Brandon Chan and I am a programmer, web developer, guitarist, snowboarder and many other things. I enjoy following the video game scene (favourites being Dark Souls and Smash Bros) and playing board games (favourite being anything deception based).
        </p>
        <p>
        I usually get anxious around people I don't know and even around certain friends I can get quiet. I am hoping that this website helps me open up more so I can express my opinions and contribute to converstations.

            <h3>Douglas College | Computer Science and Information Systems (Diploma)</h3>
            <p>
                College fulfilled my goal of acquiring general computer/programming skills. Initially I learned how to use the Microsoft software suite such as Microsoft Word, Excel and Access. Later I moved to web design in HTML/CSS/Javascript and programming in Java/C#. Lastly I learned about system analysis & design concepts such as data visualization, development life cycles and compliance impact of new technologies.

            <h3>Simon Fraser University | SIAT </h3>
            <p>
                After graduating college and I attempted to find a job. I found many jobs had a prerequisite to have previous work experience in their field. In order to get this, I went to SFU to get into their co-op program. As I was still uncertain which field I would want to get into, I chose the IAT program as it grabbed my interests in both arts and technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                IAT gave me the opportunity to work with many different types of projects. These include projects like a <a href="https://youtu.be/iYeaIBA6gFU">toy hack</a> where I worked with arduinos and electronic sensors, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62m6Cx3G8QE">mobile game</a> using android studio and <a href="https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/">libGDX</a>, and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=941JfJo0rbg">kinetic typography video</a> where I learned to use Adobe After Effects.

            <h3>Quality Assurance Engineer | Powerex     </h3>
            <p>
                Following my two terms at SFU I was hired as a QA Engineer co-op at Powerex who is a company that works with electricity trading and is a subsidiary of BCHydro. I was responsible for conducting regression tests and creating automated tests using Ranorex and Powershell. I worked closely with the developers to investigate bugs and brainstorm solutions. This was also my first experience with the agile development process.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon completing my co-op I was asked if I want to continue working at Powerex in the same role. I accepted on the condition that I would eventually get a developer role as I have more interest in developing than testing. As I stayed longer with the company, they allowed me to conduct co-op interviews and become a mentor to them.

            <h3>Software Developer | Powerex</h3>
            <p>
                After waiting for the opportunity, a position opened up and I became a software developer at Powerex. I mainly worked on maintaining software using .NET, VBA, SQL, Oracle and Powershell. Many of the applications built were used to download data by scraping websites as well as creating reports for our internal business users.

            <h3>Business Intelligence Developer | Powerex         </h3>
            <p>
                At Powerex, the BI team was hiring for a new developer. This peaked my interest as their team had veteran employees that I could learn from. After the internal interviews they chose me and I accepted. As a BI, I learned a lot about ETLs, data warehouse design and data modeling. I use SSIS, Powershell, Matillion and Python to load and verify our data. I also work closely with our database admins to maintain our SQL, Oracle and Snowflake databases.
